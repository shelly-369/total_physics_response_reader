# total_physics_response_reader
Total physical response (TPR) is a method for people learning a new language. Google this for more details. I named this project TPR reader, and while it may not as good as others, it gets the job done. That's enough, I guess.

# Usage
## Before
1. Install language packages.
  Open Windows 11 sittings => Time & language => Languages & region => Add language, and choose the language that you want to learn(Support Text-to-speech only)
2. Modify code in .html file and .js file.
  add a new brench to condition statement as you wish. If I want to learn French and then add its language code, fr-CA (Link below). Change .html file at the same time.
3. Prepare your .json file, and its format is as follows.
  {
  "Number": 1,
  "Word": "aime"
  }
